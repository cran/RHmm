RHmm package version 1.2.0


Make instructions
-----------------


Somme source and header files are used only for the R shared library (for example, RHmm.*pp or RUtil.*pp) 
RHmm can be used as a standalone library (don't define _RDLL_ in your Makefile), but still needs RLapack library and access to R_Ext/RLapack.h

Thanks to: 
- Mait Raag who found a bug in may Multivariate Normal Density function (version <= 1.03).
- Tarmo Leinonen who found some problems in the forwardbackward procedure
- Matteo Re who found bugs in Viterbi path procedure (for discrete distributions)
