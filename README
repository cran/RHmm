RHmm package version 1.5.0 - May, 12th, 2011

Make instructions
-----------------


RHmm can be used as a standalone library. if R_HOME is R directory, go into RHmm/src and
1) compile all .cpp using g++ -c *.cpp -I R_HOME/include -w
2) link the program using 
	On unix system: g++ -o main *.o -W1,-Bstatic -lRlapack -lRblas -L R_HOME/lib
	On windows system: g++ -o main *.o -W1,-Bstatic -lR -lRlapack -lRblas -L R_HOME/bin
3) To execute the main program,
	on unix system: copy R_HOME/lib/libRlapack.so and R_HOME/lib/libRblas.so in RHmm/src directory
	on windows system: copy R_HOME/bin/*.dll in Rhmm/src directory
then you can execute the main program by doing ./main in RHmm/src directory. Main.cpp is an example of the main program. At the end of Main.cpp file, you will find some samples used for testing the library.
or
1') Use the makefile programe in src/makevar
