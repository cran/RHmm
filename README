RHmm package version 1.0.4


Make instructions
-----------------


Somme source and header files are used only for the R shared library (for example, RHmm.*pp or RUtil.*pp) 
RHmm can be used as a standalone library : don't define _RDLL_ in your Makefile, but still needs RLapack library and access to R_Ext/RLapack.h

Thanks to Mait Raag who finds a bug in may Multivariate Normal Density function (version <= 1.03).
